Just about anything I write here will change over time. However, there are a few things that will stand the test of time. I'm a bit of a wanderer, moving from place to place, learning and growing in the process. I was born in Kolkata, India in 1999 and I moved to the United States in 2018. Moving from city to city may seem unsettling to some, but to me it has led me down the path of self-discovery. When you don't make yourself too comfortable/settled, there is a possibility for growth. That's been the mantra for my life - to always seek new challenges everyday. That's how we evolve. The feeling I get everytime I push past my own limits is what makes life worth living. The desire to get better, the abilitity to push past discomfort, to show up every single day -- these are the core tenets I live my life by.
