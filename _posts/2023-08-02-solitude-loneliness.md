Is it possible to be in solitude and not feel any sense of loneliness? This is a thought I’ve been grappling with for a while, and I’m really interested in exploring it further. A lot of the times I’ve seen people spending time with each other, even though they are not very fond of them. I think this is likely because they can’t bear to be by themselves. Shouldn’t we work on being better friends to ourselves? If we can’t bear alone time, there must be some internal dissonance we’re fleeing from. We’re distracting ourselves with external stimuli - be it mindless scrolling, TV, drugs, or alcohol.

There have been times in the past where I have disliked being devoid of any company. I think the primary reason for this is I was lost in thought. Patterns of thought that were destructive and self-defeating. I have found meditation and exercise to be powerful activities to escape these vicious traps. One of the primary reflections from meditating is how anything that emerges in consciousness eventually passes away. The same applies to negative experiences as well. Instead of fighting the feeling, I try to accept it wholeheartedly as another appearance within conscious experience. By not fighting it, it eventually loses its power and I’m back to feeling the same sense of calm.

Speaking of calm, exercise has played a great role in reducing my anxiety and lifting my mood. It has also embedded within me the value of discipline, and how small efforts daily can compound into huge returns in the future.

When it comes to being in solitude, I believe you can only truly enjoy another’s company if you’re totally fine with being by yourself. When I reach this state of equanimity, I only engage with individuals who I have much to learn from and with whom I can have a truly positive experience. The feeling has to be mutual. Organic relationships like these only work if both parties stand to gain from the interaction.

Over this next week, I will largely be by myself. I plan to use this time mindfully - observing myself, my tendencies, habits, thoughts - and also get some much needed focus time to earn the rare and valuable skills that will pay great dividends in the future.
