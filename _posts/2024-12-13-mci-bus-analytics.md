Urban campus transportation systems face numerous challenges, including traffic congestion, road
maintenance, and resource allocation. The Sting-Sense project addresses these issues by implementing
an advanced analytics system on GTâ€™s bus network. This system provides visibility into bus behavior
across different times of the day, enabling data-driven decision-making for transportation management.
