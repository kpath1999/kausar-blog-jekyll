I do a lot of things. My main thing currently is graduate school. We're officially in the intelligence age and I don't want to miss out on the fun. So I joined Georgia Tech in August 2024 as a researcher. There's nothing more exciting than the work that's happening within machine learning and robotics. This really is the next stage in our evolution as a species.

I'm from Kolkata, India - lived there for the first 18 years of my life. I went to college in Champaign, Illinois, worked for a couple years in Chicago, and now I'm in Altanta. I have a life outside school too, you know. I sometimes interact with the physical world, doing CrossFit, meditating, reading and playing the piano.
